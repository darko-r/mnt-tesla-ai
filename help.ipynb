In the other, the fluid is admitted at full pressure to curved blades or channels in the rotor where it expands imparting energy to the same and causing it to turn by reaction.

But although this idea seems sound, the temperature range has not been very much increased through its application and in gain, so far effected, is moderate indeed, to the point of being doubtful in many instances. Definite limits to progress in this direction have been reached in the existing commercial apparatus and the discovery of other ways and means for saving fuel and reducing the cost of installment and operation has become a problem rendered especially pressing throughout the world by the greatly increased cost of this commodity.',\n",
       " 'The advantages of the action and reaction principles can be more completely realized through a process which constitutes my present invention and, briefly stated, consists in deriving motive power from the heat of an elastic medium first by means of friction and then by reaction. The best instrumentalities for the purpose, of which I am aware, are a turbine of the kind described in my British Patent No. 24, 001 of 1910 and one of Parsons type, both being connected or worked independently. The fluid is admitted to my tribune through a suitable nozzle which may be expanding, straight or converging, and in traversing the spaces between the disks exercises a frictional drag, thus transforming a part of the available heat into mechanical work. Upon exhausting under proper temperature and pressure conditions it is passed through the Parsons turbine which another portion of its caloric energy is usefully converted by reaction. Careful scientific investigation, supported by experiment, has shown that important economic results can be secured by the new method and that this particular combination of apparatus possesses features of unusual merit.',\n",

Again, the former permits the fluid to be expanded either in the nozzle, the rotor or both, and this flexibility facilitates the establishment and maintenance of pressure and temperature conditions favorable to both turbines, thus enhancing economy. Their combination is, however, of quite exceptional value in cases when reversible units are indispensable, as on shipboard, where it provides a simpler, more efficient and far more effective apparatus for forward propulsion as well as backing, my turbine being much better adapted for reversing purposes the other forms with small clearances and delicate blading easily damaged.',\n",

       " 'The economic advantages contemplated can be more completely realized through a process which constitutes my present invention and, briefly stated, consists in converting part of the heat energy of an elastic medium into mechanical work by friction, preferably at a high temperature, and a further part by action or reaction at the lower temperature. The best instrumentalities for the purpose, of which I am aware, are friction turbine of the kind described in my British Patent No. 24, 001 of 1910 and one of the reaction type, such as the Parsons, both being connected or worked independently.

       " 'In accompanying drawings Fig.1 is intended to represent my improved turbine and one of the Parsons type operatively joined and with their shafts flexibly connected; Fig. 2 is a plan view of the same with supply conduits and inlet valves, and Fig.3 a vertical cross-section of my turbine.',\n",
       " 'Referring to figures, 1 illustrates the rotor of my turbine enclosed in a casing 2, 2, provided with two inlets 3, 3 for the working medium, nozzles 4 and 5 – one for normal operation and the other for reversal – and two exhaust openings 6, 6 which lead through c conduit 7 to the intake 8 and slide valve 9 of the Parsons turbine 10. The exhaust 11 of the latter communicates through a conduit 12 with the condenser to which is also connected a by-pass 13, branching out from exhaust pipe 7 and equipped with a valve 14. A throttle valve 15 controls the admission of the elastic fluid to my turbine which has, besides, two suitable valves 16 and 17, preferably joined by mechanical means as chain 18, enabling them to be turned together so that one will be closed tight while the other is wide open.',\n",
       " 'In normal operation valves 17 and 14 are closed and the medium is admitted to my turbine through valves 15, 18 and nozzle 4, whence it passes through the rotor 1, exhaust opening 6, 6 and pipe 7 to the intake 8 and valve 9 of the Parsons turbine 10 and, after traversing the same, is discharged through exhaust 11 and conduit 12 into the condenser, under which conditions both the turbines are actuated in the same direction, rotation taking place in the sense of the solid arrow Fig.3. When it is desired to operate in the reverse direction (indicated by the dotted arrow), valves 16 and 9 are closed and 17 and 14 opened wide, the medium entering my turbine through nozzle 5, and after passing through the rotor 1, exhaust openings 6, 6, pipe 7 and by-pass 13, discharges into the condenser. The Parsons turbine is then driven in a direction opposite to its blading but offers a relatively small resistance owing to the vacuum therein; my turbine, on the other hand, develops an amount of power much greater than when working as first described on account of its direct connection with the condenser and correspondingly increased heat drop.',\n",
       " 'Careful scientific investigation, supported by experiment, has shown that important economic results can be secured by the new method and that this particular combination of apparatus possesses features of unusual merit.',\n",

Their combination is, however, of quite exceptional value in cases when reversible units are indispensable, as on shipboard, where it provides a simpler and more effective apparatus for forward propulsion as well as backing, my turbine being much more dependable than the present forms with buckets and blades which are very liable to deterioration and easily damaged.',\n",
       " 'In the use of different types, as here contemplated, the individual heat drops in them may be considerably varied in magnitude, but to give a practical example I would say that very good results, when working with superheated steam alone, are obtainable by admitting the steam to the nozzle of the friction turbine at about 1100 degrees F, and exhausting it at approximately 550 degrees F, into a reaction turbine capable of operating safely at that temperature.',\n",
       " 'While my turbine in such combinations will yield the best results in co-operation with the Parsons, it is eminently qualified to serve as first stage, or stages, in conjunction with other types of turbines, of whatever kind; also with rotary and reciprocating engines, and in this boarder sense my improved process may be defined as one in which the available heat energy of an elastic fluid is usefully transformed first by friction, as indicated, and then by action or reaction.',\n",
