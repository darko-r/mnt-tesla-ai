      "page_content='February 24th, 1893 1 On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena Delivered before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, February 1893, and before the \\nNational Electric Light Association, St. Louis, March 1893.Introductory — Some Thoughts on the Eye When we look at the world around us, on Nature, we are impressed with its beauty and \\ngrandeur. Each thing we perceive, though it may be vanishingly small, is in itself a world, that \\nis, like the whole of the universe, matter and force governed by law, — a world, the \\ncontemplation of which fills us with feelings of wonder and irresistibly urges us to ceaseless \\nthought and inquiry. But in all this vast world, of all objects our senses reveal to us, the most \\nmarvellous, the most appealing to our imagination, appears no doubt a highly developed \\norganism, a thinking being. If there is anything fitted to make us admire Nature’s handiwork, it \\nis certainly this inconceivable structure, which performs its innumerable motions of obedience \\nto external influence. To understand its workings, to get a deeper insight into this Nature’s \\nmasterpiece, has ever been for thinkers a fascinating aim, and after many centuries of arduous \\nresearch men have arrived at a fair understanding of the functions of its organs and senses. \\nAgain, in all the perfect harmony of its parts, of the parts which constitute the material or \\ntangible of our being, of all its organs and senses, the eye is the most wonderful. It is the most \\nprecious, the most indispensable of our perceptive or directive organs, it is the great gateway \\nthrough which all knowledge enters the mind. Of all our organs, it is the one, which is in the \\nmost intimate relation with that which we call intellect. So intimate is this relation, that it is \\noften said, the very soul shows itself in the eye.It can be taken as a fact, which the theory of the action of the eye implies, that for each \\nexternal impression, that is, for each image produced upon the retina, the ends of the visual \\nnerves, concerned in the conveyance of the impression to the mind, must be under a peculiar \\nstress or in a vibratory state, It now does not seem improbable that, when by the power of thought \\nan image is evoked, a distinct reflex action, no matter how weak, is exerted upon certain ends \\nof the visual nerves, and therefore upon the retina. Will it ever be within human power to analyse \\nthe condition of the retina when disturbed by thought or reflex action, by the help of some \\noptical or other means of such sensitiveness, that a clear idea of its state might be gained at any \\ntime? If this were possible, then the problem of reading one’s thoughts with precision, like the \\ncharacters of an open book, might be much easier to solve than many problems belonging to the \\ndomain of positive physical science, in the solution of which many, if not the majority, of \\nscientific men implicitly believe. Helmholtz has shown that the fundi of the eye are themselves, \\nluminous, and he was able to see, in total darkness, the movement of his arm by the light of his \\nown eyes. This is one of the most remarkable experiments recorded in the history of science, \\nand probably only a few men could satisfactorily repeat it, for it is very likely, that the luminosity \\nof the eyes is associated with uncommon activity of the brain and great imaginative power. It is \\nfluorescence of brain action, as it were.Another fact having a bearing on this subject which has probably been noted by many, \\nsince it is stated in popular expressions, but which I cannot recollect to have found chronicled \\nas a positive result of observation is, that at times, when a sudden idea or image presents itself \\nto the intellect, there is a distinct and sometimes painful sensation of luminosity produced in the \\neye, observable even in broad daylight.' metadata={'page': 0, 'date': '1893-02-24', 'source': 'Archives of the Nikola Tesla Museum', 'document_type': 'lecture', 'document_name': 'On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena'}\n"
