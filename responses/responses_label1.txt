         - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned the future of travel to involve the use of dirigibles, or airships, of the Zeppelin type. He believed that these airships would be propelled more rapidly than airplanes and would be safer. He also believed that wireless transmission of power would revolutionize aircraft, allowing them to be powered without the need for carrying fuel. Tesla saw the potential for airships and airplanes to travel great distances economically and without limitations on their radius of action.
      - Retriever: multi_query
         - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned a future of travel that included advancements in aerial and sea navigation, wireless telegraphy, and wireless transmission of power. He believed that wireless telegraphy and telephony would make astounding strides, with the possibility of wireless transmission across the Pacific and trans-Atlantic wireless telephony. He also believed that the use of wireless telephones in isolated districts would spread rapidly. In terms of aerial navigation, Tesla believed that aeroplanes would not be able to soar and that dirigible balloons would be a safer and faster mode of transportation. He also believed that improvements would be made in ship propulsion, with the introduction of a new principle that would replace the propeller. Additionally, Tesla believed in the future adoption of electricity for the propulsion of automobiles, trains, and ocean liners, eliminating the need for carrying fuel and allowing for greater speed and economy.
      - Retriever: compression_retriever
         - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned the future of travel to involve the use of dirigibles, specifically of the Zeppelin type, as a common vehicle for travel. He believed that dirigibles could be propelled more rapidly than airplanes and would be safer overall. Tesla also believed that the use of wireless transmission of power would revolutionize aircraft, allowing for the transmission of power to them through the air. This would eliminate the need for carrying fuel on airplanes or airships and would provide virtually unlimited power supply. Tesla also saw potential for the application of electricity in automobiles, railways, and ocean liners, which would result in greater speed and economy in transportation.
