Objašnjenje: Odgovori gde Tesla kaže da ‘’Mars may be inhabited’’ su bolje rangirani od ‘’Mars was inhabited’’ jer se Tesla o spekulativnim temama  opreznije izjašnjavao. Najlošije sam rangirao ‘’I dont know’’ ili ‘’There is no information…’’ Sa br 10 je rangiran odgovor koji daje nešto malo više podataka od onog sa br 9

- Query: How did Nikola Tesla envision the future of travel?
   2 - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned the future of travel to be powered by motive power.
   3 - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned that airplanes would rise to great heights and travel at incredible speeds.
   2 - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned the future of travel to be powered by motive power.
 1   - Response: I don't know.
  3  - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned that airplanes would rise to great heights and travel at incredible speeds.
 5   - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned the future of travel to involve the use of dirigibles, or airships, of the Zeppelin type. He believed that these airships would be propelled more rapidly than airplanes and would be safer. He also believed that wireless transmission of power would revolutionize aircraft, allowing them to be powered without the need for carrying fuel. Tesla saw the potential for airships and airplanes to travel great distances economically and without limitations on their radius of action.
 7   - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned a future of travel that included advancements in aerial and sea navigation, wireless telegraphy, and wireless transmission of power. He believed that wireless telegraphy and telephony would make astounding strides, with the possibility of wireless transmission across the Pacific and trans-Atlantic wireless telephony. He also believed that the use of wireless telephones in isolated districts would spread rapidly. In terms of aerial navigation, Tesla believed that aeroplanes would not be able to soar and that dirigible balloons would be a safer and faster mode of transportation. He also believed that improvements would be made in ship propulsion, with the introduction of a new principle that would replace the propeller. Additionally, Tesla believed in the future adoption of electricity for the propulsion of automobiles, trains, and ocean liners, eliminating the need for carrying fuel and allowing for greater speed and economy.
 8   - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned the future of travel to involve the use of dirigibles, specifically of the Zeppelin type, as a common vehicle for travel. He believed that dirigibles could be propelled more rapidly than airplanes and would be safer overall. Tesla also believed that the use of wireless transmission of power would revolutionize aircraft, allowing for the transmission of power to them through the air. This would eliminate the need for carrying fuel on airplanes or airships and would provide virtually unlimited power supply. Tesla also saw potential for the application of electricity in automobiles, railways, and ocean liners, which would result in greater speed and economy in transportation.
  9  - Response: Nikola Tesla envisioned that aerial and sea navigation would make astounding strides in the future. He believed that wireless telegraphy and telephony would advance significantly, allowing for wireless transmission across the Pacific and trans-Atlantic wireless telephony. He also predicted that the use of wireless telephones in isolated districts would spread rapidly. Additionally, Tesla believed that there would be a revolution in ideas regarding radio-activity and that progress in aerial navigation would be made, with a focus on dirigible balloons rather than heavy aeroplanes.

Objašnjenje: Najbolji bi bio onaj odgovor koji je dobio ocenu 7 samo da nema jednu netačnu rečenicu (označeno žuto). Najdetaljniji je i sve ostalo je objašnjeno dobro. Ne znam odakle mu da avioni neće moći da uzlete - činjenica je da je Tesla par godina pre nego što su braća Rajt poletela on to predvideo kao sigurnu stvar u bliskoj budućnosti…Sa 10 sam ocenio odgovor koji nema netačnosti ali je relativno kratak.
Ima jedna stvar o kojoj treba da razmisliš. Tesla je komentarisao aktuelne dogadjaje u nauci u velikom rasponu 30 možda 40 godina. Početkom 20. veka cepelini su imali veliku perspektivu pa ih je tesla ocenjivao sa više optimizma, pitanje je da li AI može da odgovori tako da ima u vidu da su se Teslini odgovori ponekad menjali tokom vremena?

Objašnjenje: Nijedan odgovor nije tačan pa je najviša ocena 9 ali to nije krivica AI jer verovatno ne postoji kontekst. Tačan odgovor je da Tesla rodjen u Smiljanu u Lici koja je u vreme njegovog rodjenja bila pogranična oblast Austrijskog carstva a od 1873 deo Austro ugarskog carstva, od 1919. deo Jugoslavije i od 1993 deo Hrvatske.
